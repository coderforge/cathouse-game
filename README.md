# 🏠 Cat House

**Cat House** is a chaotic, isometric cat management simulation game running entirely in the browser. Your goal is to manage the house's "Chaos", "Fatness", and "Scream" levels while caring for four distinct (and troublesome) cats.

🎮 **Play the Demo:** [https://cathouse.coderforge.org/](https://cathouse.coderforge.org/)

## 🐈 The Cats
Meet the troublemakers living in the house:
* **Chachi:** The orange grump. Watch out for fights!
* **Mapache:** The mischievous raccoon-like cat. Loves the garden and fighting foxes.
* **Lilu:** The food thief. Keep an eye on her or the **Fatness** meter will explode.
* **Bebu:** The screamer. Needs constant hushing to keep the **Scream** meter down.

## ✨ Features
* ** Isometric World:** A fully interactive 3D-style house view (SVG-based).
* ** Interactive Map:** Drag and move the map to explore different rooms (Mobile & Desktop supported).
* ** Day/Night Cycle:** Watch the lighting change as the in-game clock ticks.
* ** Simulation Mechanics:**
    * **Manage Stats:** Keep Chaos, Fatness, and Scream levels low to avoid "GAME OVER".
    * **Interact:** Refill food/water, clean the litter box (beware of toxic fumes!), hush the screaming cat, and massage the stressed one.
    * **Auto-AI:** Cats wander, eat, sleep, and fight based on their own internal states (hunger, thirst, anger).
* ** 📱 Mobile Responsive:** Optimized UI for phones with touch controls and a compact landscape menu.
* ** 🇮🇹 Multi-language:** Supports English, Italian, and Spanish.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** No external frameworks, pure vanilla web technologies.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Custom game loop, AI logic, and DOM manipulation.
* **SVG:** All game assets (cats, furniture, items) are drawn using inline SVG.
